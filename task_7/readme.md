# 🧪 SVM Classification - Breast Cancer Detection

This project implements Support Vector Machines (SVM) using the Breast Cancer dataset. The goal is to classify tumors as malignant or benign using linear and non-linear SVMs and visualize decision boundaries.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Load and prepare a binary classification dataset.
- Train SVM models using:
  - Linear Kernel
  - RBF (Gaussian) Kernel
- Visualize decision boundaries using PCA (2D projection).
- Tune hyperparameters like `C` and `gamma`.
- Evaluate models using accuracy, confusion matrix, and cross-validation.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `kagglehub`
